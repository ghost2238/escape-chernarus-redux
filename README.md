Escape Chernarus Redux
======================
Escape Chernarus is a mission for ARMA 2: Combined Operations created by Engima.
See https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/124404-escape-chernarus-mission-release for more information.

## Story
You are a USMC special force held captive in Chernarus some time before the US invasion. 
Your objective is to somehow contact your allies and rendezvous with a rescue force. 

Find your way through the living environment of enemy hunters directed by an intelligent search leader, enemy forces, civilians, traffic, animals, ambient events and surprises. 

The mission is 100% dynamic and uses the entire map. Play it 100 times, two games will not be the same!

## Redux mod
The goal of this mod was to add more options, variety, fix bugs and add a few features.

## Status

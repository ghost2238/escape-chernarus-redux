## Redux mod
The main goals of this mod is to add more options, variety, fix bugs and add new features. It's also sort of an excuse for me to learn SQF, since I havn't touched SQF scripting since the early OFP days about 10 years ago. Some things may alter the feeling of the mission drastically, but my objective is to make as much as possible optional and be as transparent as I can with all changes.

## Story
You are a USMC special force held captive in Chernarus some time before the US invasion. 
Your objective is to somehow contact your allies and rendezvous with a rescue force. 
Find your way through the living environment of enemy hunters directed by an intelligent search leader, enemy forces, civilians, traffic, animals, ambient events and surprises. Mission is 100% dynamic and uses the entire map. Play it 100 times, two games will not be the same!
